# bash-scripting-basics
LinkedIn Learning course on bash scripting - Below exercise files are from the course (2013 timestamps) and not mine:
auth.log
Directories: trees, pets, fruit, challenges
ch<x>_examples.sh are the scripts I wrote during the course based on each chapter.
ch<x>_challenge are my attempts to some basic challenge questions from the course.

To convert any bash script to an executable run: chmod u+x <filename.sh>
To run the script: ./filename

Bash scripting is fun, give it a try!
